<h1>Reasons I chose these ideas</h1>
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>As an art major, having a good portfolio is probably the only thing that matters, so I think making my own website would be effective. My major covers everything under Media Arts, so dislpaying a bit of everything I studied would be nice! Web design is a weakness of mine and I'd like to make a banging website portfolio to also just prove to myself that I can do it.</p>

<h1>Personal Blog</h1>
<p>This was more of a fun idea than anything. My cat is silly and I think she would look great on her own website with pictures and paragraphs of her antics. I'd want to add some music, or link songs, to make the site a bit lively and personal.</p>


<h1>Small Business Site</h1>
<p>This was an idea I made with my friend a few weeks ago. She sells her beaded Native jewelry using social media as her advertisement, and I offered making her a website once I was confident with my skills. She makes great sales, but being able to take her small busniess to the next level would mean a lot to me!</p>
