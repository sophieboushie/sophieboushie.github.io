<h1> Website Ideas</h1>
<h2>Profesional Portfolio</h2>
<p> I think presenting a final portfolio as a website would be fun, and a nice showcase of my work.</p>


<h1>Personal Blog</h1>
<h2>Something fun and silly</h2>
<p>It could be fun to create a website full of ugly pictures of my cat, maybe add some funky music too.</p>



    <h1>Small Business Site</h1>
<h2>Personal and Fun</h2>
   <p>I'd like to build a website for my friend so she can advertise and sell her hand made Native American jewelry. Below is just an example of what she can make, but her designs are unique and cuter. </p>

<h1>Reasons I chose these ideas</h1>
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>As an art major, having a good portfolio is probably the only thing that matters, so I think making my own website would be effective. My major covers everything under Media Arts, so dislpaying a bit of everything I studied would be nice! Web design is a weakness of mine and I'd like to make a banging website portfolio to also just prove to myself that I can do it.</p>

<h1>Personal Blog</h1>
<p>This was more of a fun idea than anything. My cat is silly and I think she would look great on her own website with pictures and paragraphs of her antics. I'd want to add some music, or link songs, to make the site a bit lively and personal.</p>


<h1>Small Business Site</h1>
<p>This was an idea I made with my friend a few weeks ago. She sells her beaded Native jewelry using social media as her advertisement, and I offered making her a website once I was confident with my skills. She makes great sales, but being able to take her small busniess to the next level would mean a lot to me!</p>
